README
-------------------------------------------
This repository contains a template you can use for your computational project 
report. It's in the report directory and I hope you'll rename it (try `git mv`) 
to your own last name (e.g. huff-report.tex) if you decide to use it.

However, this is your repository. Create, delete, and reorganize to your 
heart's content (including rewriting this readme). I strongly recommend 
separating your source code, data, and output into separate directories. I also 
would really appreciate instructions, in this readme, that give some 
instructions on reprocuding your results with this code.
