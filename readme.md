README
-------------------------------------------
This repository contains a template you can use for your computational project 
report. It's in the report directory and I hope you'll rename it (try `git mv`) 
to your own last name (e.g. huff-report.tex) if you decide to use it.

However, this is your repository. Create, delete, and reorganize to your 
heart's content (including rewriting this readme).
